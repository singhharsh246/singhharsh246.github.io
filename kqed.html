    <p>At UC Davis, I worked with five other students in collaboration with KQED, a non-profit media organization based in the Bay Area, to reduce donor churn and improve their overall fundraising efforts. Our project involved creating user personas, developing targeted strategies, and migrating their donor data from Excel sheets to a data warehouse in MongoDB.<br><br>

To start the project, we conducted extensive research on KQED's donor base and their giving patterns. We then used this information to create user personas that helped us better understand the motivations and behaviors of KQED's donors. We used these personas to develop targeted strategies for each donor group to improve their engagement and reduce churn.<br><br>

We also identified some of the pain points in KQED's donor management system, such as the use of multiple Excel sheets to store donor data, which led to duplication and inconsistency. To address these issues, we proposed migrating their donor data to a centralized data warehouse in MongoDB, which allowed for easier management and analysis of the data.<br><br>

We worked closely with KQED's team to ensure a smooth transition to the new system and provided training on how to use the new tools and dashboards we created. The new system enabled KQED to have a better understanding of their donors' behavior and allowed them to make data-driven decisions to improve their fundraising efforts.<br><br>

Overall, our project with KQED was a success, and we were able to help them reduce their donor churn and improve their fundraising efforts through the use of user personas and a centralized data warehouse.</p>
