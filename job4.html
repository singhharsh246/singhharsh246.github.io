    <p> As part of my work at Johns Hopkins University, I worked on a fascinating and challenging project in the field of computational mechanics and materials science. Specifically, my goal was to understand the movement of twinning dislocations inside Mg (magnesium) and model the entire mechanical process using a technique called discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) and high-performance computing. <br><br>

Twinning dislocations are defects in the crystal structure of a material that can significantly affect its mechanical properties. Understanding how these dislocations move and interact with each other is crucial for developing stronger, more durable materials. <br><br>

To study twinning dislocations, we used a technique called discrete dislocation dynamics, which involves simulating the behavior of individual dislocations within a crystal lattice. This technique allows us to model the mechanical response of the material at the microscale and gain insights into the underlying physical mechanisms. <br><br>

However, simulating the movement of thousands or even millions of individual dislocations requires massive computational power, which is why we utilized high-performance computing to run our simulations. We developed a simulation code that could run efficiently on parallel computing architectures, which allowed us to simulate the behavior of large numbers of dislocations in a reasonable amount of time. <br><br>

By combining the power of discrete dislocation dynamics with high-performance computing, we were able to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanics of twinning dislocations in Mg and how they affect the material's overall behavior. Our work has the potential to lead to the development of new, stronger materials that can withstand extreme conditions and environments.<br><br>

        In addition to this project, I also worked on a couple of ad hoc projects aimed at improving the performance of existing simulation codes. Specifically, I focused on reducing the run time of these codes using GPUs (graphics processing units).<br><br>

GPUs are highly parallel computing devices that can perform many computations simultaneously. By harnessing the power of GPUs, we can significantly speed up simulations and reduce the time required to obtain results.<br><br>

To reduce the run time of existing codes using GPUs, I first had to understand the structure and behavior of these codes. I then worked to identify the bottlenecks that were slowing down the simulation and optimize the code accordingly.<br><br>

This involved rewriting some portions of the code to take advantage of the parallel processing power of GPUs, optimizing memory access patterns, and reducing unnecessary computations. By making these improvements, I was able to significantly reduce the run time of the simulation code and improve its overall performance.<br><br>

Overall, my work on these ad hoc projects helped me gain a deeper understanding of the principles of high-performance computing and the potential of GPUs for accelerating scientific simulations.<br><br>
