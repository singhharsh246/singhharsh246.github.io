    <p>Simpl is the second largest 'Buy Now Pay Later' player in the Indian market with around 1.5 million monthly active users. At Simpl, I have been involved with various projects, ranging from creating automated dashboards to productionizing large scale ML models.</p>

    <h2>Project 1: MIS data automation</h2>
    <p>As a part of my job responsibilities, I was responsible for generating and submitting Management Information System (MIS) reports every week. The process of generating these reports was highly manual and time-consuming. It involved collating data from multiple sources, cleaning and formatting the data, and then creating the report in a specific format using Microsoft Excel. The process was repetitive and prone to errors, and it took approximately 40 hours every week to complete.<p>

    <p>To address this issue, I decided to automate the process of generating MIS reports using Python programming language and SQL. I first identified the data sources and the format in which the data was required for the report. I then wrote a Python script to extract the data from AWS redshift using SQL into the required format. The script also performed data cleaning and transformation to ensure data accuracy and consistency.<p>

    <p>After the data was extracted and formatted, it was getting saved in AWS S3. The process of data extraction and formatting was scheduled at regular intervals using Airflow. The path to the file was then used in Qliksense powerview and the tables were created in the required format.<p>

    <p>After implementing this automation solution, the time required to generate the MIS reports was reduced from 40 hours, since it involved multiple stakeholder to manually enter their data points, to just 8 hours, a savings of 32 hours every week. The process was also much more accurate and reliable, as the chances of human error were greatly reduced. The stakeholders were also pleased with the improved report quality, as the automated solution allowed for more detailed analysis and trend identification.<p>

Overall, by automating the process of generating MIS reports, I was able to save 32 hours of work time every week, reduce the chances of human error, and improve the quality of the reports. The solution was well-received by all stakeholders and contributed to increased productivity and efficiency in the company.

    <h2>Project 2: Rule based filters to reduce delinquent amount</h2>
    <p>As a part of my work as a data scientist, I was tasked with analyzing the delinquent accounts on simpl's platform to identify patterns that could help prevent future delinquencies. One area that caught my attention was the use of network characteristics to identify fraudulent or suspicious accounts. To address this issue, I developed a rule-based system using network characteristics like the number of users using the same device (device ids) or email ID.<p>

    <p>The first step in developing the rule-based system was to identify the relevant network characteristics that could be used to identify fraudulent or suspicious accounts. I used data mining techniques to analyze transaction data and identified several network characteristics that were common among delinquent accounts. These included multiple users sharing the same device or email ID, users with a high number of connections to other delinquent accounts, and users with a high frequency of connections to other suspicious accounts.<p>

    <p>Once the relevant network characteristics were identified, I developed a rule-based system that used these characteristics to flag accounts that were deemed to be suspicious or at high risk of delinquency. The system was integrated into the company's existing fraud detection system, which allowed for real-time monitoring of the flagged accounts.<p>

    <p>The result of the analysis was significant. By using the rule-based system, we were able to reduce the delinquent amount by $30,000 per month. The system was able to flag suspicious accounts before they became delinquent, which allowed the company to take proactive measures to prevent delinquencies. The system was also able to identify previously undetected patterns of fraud, which helped to improve the overall accuracy of the fraud detection system.<p>

Overall, my work on the rule-based system using network characteristics was a success. By identifying and using relevant network characteristics, we were able to significantly reduce the delinquent amount, improve the accuracy of the fraud detection system, and prevent future delinquencies. The system was well-received by the company and contributed to increased efficiency and productivity in the company's operations.

    <h2>Project 3: Reducing repeat user delinquency using Machine Learning model</h2>
    <p>As a data scientist, I was tasked with identifying ways to reduce the churn rate for repeat users on our platform. After analyzing user behavior data, I noticed a pattern that users who eventually went delinquent exhibited different behavior when they signed up compared to users who remained active. To address this issue, I decided to create an ML model that would take into account user behavior when they signed up on the platform as compared to when the user went delinquent.<p>

    <p>The first step in creating the ML model was to gather and clean data on user behavior. I collected data on user sign-up behavior, such as the time of day and day of the week when they signed up, the device they used to sign up, and the features they interacted with during sign-up. I also collected data on user behavior leading up to delinquency, such as the frequency and amount of transactions, the average balance in their account, and the time of day and day of the week when they accessed the platform.<p>

    <p>After collecting and cleaning the data, I used a supervised learning algorithm to train the ML model to predict the likelihood of a user going delinquent. The algorithm used the user behavior data collected during sign-up as well as the user behavior data leading up to delinquency as input variables.<p>

    <p>Once the model was trained, it was integrated into the platform's fraud detection system. The system would flag users who were deemed to be at high risk of delinquency based on the model's predictions. The flagged users would then be targeted with customized outreach campaigns aimed at reducing the risk of delinquency.<p>

    <p>The result of the ML model was a 20% reduction in churn for repeat users. By taking into account user behavior when they signed up on the platform as compared to when the user went delinquent, we were able to identify at-risk users early and take proactive measures to prevent delinquency. The customized outreach campaigns were well-received by users and led to increased user engagement and retention.<p>

Overall, my work on the ML model was a success. By creating an ML model that took into account user behavior when they signed up on the platform as compared to when the user went delinquent, we were able to significantly reduce the churn rate for repeat users. The model was well-received by the company and contributed to increased efficiency and productivity in the company's operations.</p>
