    <p>As a graduate research analyst at UC Davis, I worked under the guidance of Prof. Jorn and Prof. Prasad, analyzing Kickstarter data from 2014 to 2019 to determine the factors that contribute to project success. The analysis included examining texts, images, videos, and comments to identify various features that could define success. <br><br>

Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that allows creators to raise money from backers to bring their projects to life. However, not all Kickstarter projects are successful. Many fail to meet their funding goals, while others barely scrape by. Your research aimed to identify the characteristics of successful projects and determine how creators can improve their chances of success.<br><br>

To achieve this, I first collected and organized a large dataset of Kickstarter projects from 2014 to 2019. Next, I analyzed the dataset to identify patterns and trends in the features of successful projects. Some of the features I examined included the project's title, description, video, funding goal, category, location, and funding duration.<br><br>

I also analyzed the comments section of each project to gain insight into how backers engage with creators and how creators respond to feedback. This provided valuable information about the level of community engagement surrounding each project and the impact it had on success.<br><br>

Based on my analysis, I identified several key features that are strongly correlated with project success on Kickstarter. These included having a clear and concise project description, high-quality images and videos, engaging with backers through comments and updates, setting realistic funding goals, and targeting the right audience.<br><br>

I also found that certain categories of projects were more likely to be successful than others. For example, technology, design, and food projects tended to be more successful than projects in other categories.<br><br>

Overall, my research has provided valuable insights into what makes a Kickstarter project successful. My findings can help creators optimize their projects to improve their chances of success and provide a roadmap for future research into crowdfunding platforms.</p>
